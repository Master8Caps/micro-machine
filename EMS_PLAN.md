# Easy Micro SaaS — Project Plan

## Project Overview

Easy Micro SaaS is a platform that guides micro-SaaS builders through the full product lifecycle — from finding an idea to getting their first 100 users. The marketing module (Phase 1) turns a simple product brief into a structured early-growth engine.

**Primary audience (initial):** Internal micro-SaaS products built by the team.
**Future audience:** Solo founders, indie hackers, early-stage SaaS teams.
**Domain:** easymicrosaas.com

### What It Does (Marketing Module — Phase 1)

1. Collects a short product/market/goals brief
2. Identifies and refines target avatars (ICPs)
3. Generates social campaign angles per avatar per channel
4. Generates ad campaign angles (retargeting + cold traffic) if user opts in
5. Generates a website kit (landing page copy, welcome emails, meta descriptions, taglines) if user has a website
6. Produces channel-specific content pieces with copy-to-clipboard
7. Tracks clicks and early engagement signals via redirect links
8. (Future) Identifies winning hooks/angles/avatars and regenerates based on performance

### Architecture

- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- **Marketing site** (`apps/marketing`): Conversion-focused single page, deployed to `easymicrosaas.com`
- **App** (`apps/app`): SaaS application, deployed to `app.easymicrosaas.com`
- **Shared packages:** UI components, TypeScript configs, shared types

## Completed Work

### Infrastructure & Setup
- [x] Monorepo scaffolding (pnpm workspaces + Turborepo)
- [x] Root config: package.json, turbo.json, .gitignore, .npmrc, prettier
- [x] Shared packages: `@repo/config`, `@repo/ui`, `@repo/types`
- [x] Environment variables declared in turbo.json for Vercel builds
- [x] Vercel deployment (two projects — marketing + app)
- [x] Git repo on GitHub (Master8Caps/easy-micro-saas)

### Data & Cache
- [x] `revalidatePath` added to all mutating server actions (products, content) to fix stale data across page navigation

### Database & Auth
- [x] Supabase project setup
- [x] Database schema — 11 tables: profiles, products, generations, avatars, campaigns, content_pieces, links, clicks, customers, subscriptions, waitlist
- [x] RLS policies on all tables (users access own data only)
- [x] Fix: Missing update policy on generations table (migration 00003)
- [x] Supabase Auth (email/password signup + login)
- [x] Protected routes via middleware (session refresh + route protection)
- [x] User roles system (admin, free, paid) — migration 00002
- [x] Content workstreams separation — migration 00004 (has_website, wants_ads, campaign categories, expanded content types)
- [x] Archived separated from workflow status — migration 00005 (archived boolean on campaigns + content_pieces, removed from status constraint)
- [x] Content format preferences — migration 00006 (content_formats column on products, video-hook removed from constraints)

### Database Hardening
- [x] Migration 00012: Fixed mutable `search_path` on `handle_new_user()` and `increment_click_count()` — `SET search_path = ''`
- [x] Migration 00013: Dropped 4 duplicate indexes (auto-created by UNIQUE constraints + manual CREATE INDEX)
- [x] Migration 00014: Optimised 26 RLS policies — wrapped `auth.uid()` in `(select auth.uid())` for per-query evaluation instead of per-row

### Marketing Site
- [x] 7-section conversion page (hero, problem, value, how-it-works, proof, CTA, footer)
- [x] Space Grotesk + Inter font setup
- [x] Dark-mode-first styling

- [x] Step 4: "Do you have a website?" toggle + URL input
- [x] Step 4: "Do you want to run paid ads?" toggle + platform multi-select (Meta, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn Ads)

- [x] "Paid Ads" removed from social channels list
- [x] Step 3: Grouped channel layout — Social Media (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest), Communities (Reddit, Product Hunt, Indie Hackers), Content & Outreach (Email, Blog/SEO) with 3-column grid

### App — Marketing Brain Generation
- [x] Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 integration (real, not mocked)
- [x] Structured JSON output — avatars, social campaigns, ad campaigns (conditional), website kit (conditional)
- [x] Avatars saved to DB with ICPs, pain points, channels
- [x] Social campaigns saved with category='social'
- [x] Ad campaigns saved with category='ad' (retargeting + cold traffic angles)

- [x] Multi-format ad content — ad campaigns generate full creative package (ad copy + image brief + video script) based on content_formats preference; Google ads text-only
- [x] Content format preferences respected — brain prompt dynamically builds content types list from user's selected formats (text/images/video)
- [x] Inline content preview on brain page (expandable)
- [x] Copy-to-clipboard with "Copied!" feedback
- [x] Fix: "Generate All" skips campaigns that already have content (no more duplicates)

- [x] Expandable body preview (line-clamp-3)
- [x] Copy-to-clipboard on each piece

### App — Archiving & Status
- [x] Archived is a separate boolean flag, not a status value
- [x] Workflow status (draft/ready/published) preserved when archiving — e.g. "Published, Archived"
- [x] Product archive cascades: sets `archived=true` on all campaigns and content pieces (preserves their workflow status)
- [x] Product reactivate cascades: sets `archived=false` on all campaigns and content pieces

- [x] Archive/reactivate: admin only
- [x] Delete product: admin only (brain page + dashboard)
- [x] Lifecycle actions (LifecycleAction): available to all users

- [x] Optimistic state updates with rollback on error
- [x] Individual LifecycleAction per card still works independently

### App — Link Tracking & Analytics
- [x] Campaign destination URL — per-campaign URL field with product website_url fallback
- [x] Migration 00007: `destination_url` column on campaigns table
- [x] Tracked link generation — auto-creates unique `/r/{slug}` redirect links when content is generated (if destination URL exists)
- [x] nanoid slug generation (8-char lowercase alphanumeric)
- [x] Redirect endpoint `/r/[slug]` — looks up link in DB, logs click (user agent, referer, IP hash, country, device type), clean 302 redirect (no UTM params — internal tracking handles attribution)
- [x] Service role Supabase client for click logging (bypasses RLS per schema design)
- [x] Click counter auto-increment via existing DB trigger (clicks insert → links.click_count++)
- [x] Destination URL input on campaign panel (inline edit with save/cancel)
- [x] Tracked link display on content pieces — both campaign panel and content page (blue mono link + click count + copy button)
- [x] "Tracked" badge on campaign cards when destination URL is set

### App — Content Calendar / Schedule
- [x] `posted_at` TIMESTAMPTZ and `scheduled_for` TIMESTAMPTZ columns on content_pieces
- [x] Migration 00010: columns with partial indexes for efficient filtering
- [x] Migration 00015: `scheduled_for` converted from DATE to TIMESTAMPTZ (existing dates migrated to 09:00 UTC)
- [x] `updateContentPieceSchedule()` server action — sets scheduled_for timestamp or null, auto-sets status to `scheduled`/`approved`
- [x] New `/schedule` page — server component with week range calculation
- [x] Week navigation via `?week=N` query param (0 = current week, -1 = last week, +1 = next week)

- [x] Fix: `handleLifecycleChange` moves pieces between unscheduled/scheduled arrays

### App — Unified Content Lifecycle
- [x] Linear lifecycle: Draft → Approved → Scheduled → Posted (with shortcuts — scheduling a draft auto-approves, posting approved content skips scheduled)
- [x] Migration 00011: status constraint updated from `('draft', 'ready', 'published')` to `('draft', 'approved', 'scheduled', 'posted')` with data migration
- [x] `updateContentPieceStatus()` reworked — handles all transitions with side-effect management (clears/sets `posted_at` and `scheduled_for` as appropriate)
- [x] `markContentPiecePosted()` removed — absorbed into `updateContentPieceStatus('posted')`
- [x] `LifecycleAction` component — unified status badge + contextual next-action button + revert dropdown
  - Draft (amber) → "Approve" button
  - Approved (blue) → "Schedule" button (opens DatePicker with time selection)

  - Month navigation, 7-column Mon–Sun grid, today/selected highlights
  - 30-minute time slots from 06:00–21:00 (32 slots), defaults to 9:00 AM
  - Clicking a day selects it and shows time grid (doesn't close picker)
  - Confirm button with date+time summary
  - `onChange` emits full ISO timestamp

- [x] Content page: posted content dimmed to 60% opacity
- [x] Campaign panel: LifecycleAction replaces StatusSelect + PostedToggle
- [x] Schedule calendar: LifecycleAction on unscheduled cards; calendar cards open slide-over panel
- [x] Schedule calendar: custom DatePicker replaces native `<input type="date">`
- [x] Schedule calendar: compact calendar cards (channel pill, time, title, product, status dot) — click opens slide-over panel
- [x] Schedule calendar: slide-over panel with full content body, lifecycle action, copy button, unschedule button
- [x] DatePicker and revert dropdown positioned right-aligned (prevents overflow on right-placed triggers)

### Email Integration (Resend)
- [x] Resend package installed in both apps (`apps/app`, `apps/marketing`)
- [x] Resend client singleton (`apps/app/lib/resend.ts`) — shared instance + `EMAIL_FROM` constant
- [x] `RESEND_API_KEY` added to `turbo.json` env array for Vercel builds
- [x] Shared email template wrapper — dark theme (#09090b bg, zinc-900 card, rocket logo, indigo accents, 480px max-width)
- [x] Inline SVGs replaced with hosted `<img>` tag for Gmail/Outlook compatibility
- [x] SVG logo replaced with PNG (`logo.png`) — SVGs not supported in Gmail/Outlook; 80x80 PNG generated via sharp, hosted at `easymicrosaas.com/logo.png`
- [x] **Waitlist confirmation email** (`sendWaitlistConfirmation`) — "You're on the list" with what-happens-next card
- [x] **Account activation email** (`sendActivationEmail`) — "Your account is ready" with indigo sign-in CTA button
- [x] **Admin activation action** (`activateUser`) — verifies caller is admin, updates `profiles.status = 'active'`, looks up email via `auth.admin.getUserById`, sends activation email
- [x] App waitlist trigger — `addToWaitlist()` checks for existing entry, only sends confirmation for new signups (fire-and-forget)
- [x] Marketing site waitlist trigger — `route.ts` checks for existing entry, sends inline HTML confirmation for new signups (fire-and-forget with `.catch()`)
- [x] **Supabase email templates** — 6 branded HTML templates in `supabase/templates/` for dashboard configuration:
  - `confirm-signup.html` — "Confirm your email" with verification button

  - `magic-link.html` — "Your sign-in link" with expiry note
  - `invite-user.html` — "You've been invited" with product description

  - `reauthentication.html` — "Verify your identity" with large monospace OTP code display
- [x] All templates use consistent branded design (dark bg, indigo CTA buttons, zinc card, hosted logo, matching footer)

### App — Waitlist Gate
- [x] New sign-ups gated behind waitlist — users see "You're on the list" instead of dashboard
- [x] Two-dimensional access model: `status` (waitlist/active) + `role` (free/paid/admin)
- [x] Migration 00009: `status` column on profiles (default `waitlist`), existing users set to `active`
- [x] `handle_new_user()` trigger sets `status = 'waitlist'` for new accounts
- [x] Dashboard layout redirects `status === 'waitlist'` users to `/waitlist` page
- [x] Waitlist page (`/waitlist`): server component with auth check, shows holding message, sign-out button
- [x] Login page: after signup, shows waitlist confirmation with email and "What happens next?" card
- [x] `addToWaitlist()` server action inserts into waitlist table with source `app-signup`
- [x] `getUserWithRole()` now returns `status` alongside `role`
- [x] To grant access: change user's status from `waitlist` to `active` in Supabase
- [x] Login page form inputs polished with new design language (indigo focus states)
- [x] Fix: Middleware skip redirect for server actions (`next-action` header check) — was causing waitlist insert to fail silently

### App — Inline Avatar Editing
- [x] Brain page reads avatars from `avatars` DB table instead of frozen `generation.raw_output` JSONB
- [x] `updateAvatar()` server action — auth check, updates name/description/pain_points/channels/icp_details, RLS enforced, `revalidatePath`
- [x] `AvatarEditPanel` slide-over component — form with name, description, pain points (add/remove), channel toggles, ICP details (role/context/motivation)
- [x] Pencil edit icon on avatar cards (visible on hover)
- [x] Pain points: editable list with per-item text input + remove button + "Add pain point"
- [x] Channels: toggleable pill grid of all 12 known channels, indigo highlight when selected
- [x] ICP details: role text input, context and motivation textareas, inside bordered card
- [x] Validation: name required, at least 1 pain point, at least 1 channel
- [x] Save updates DB and closes panel, card reflects changes immediately
- [x] Old avatars deactivated (`is_active = false`) on brain regeneration — prevents stale + new duplicates
- [x] `getAvatarName()` refactored to use `avatar_id` FK instead of brittle angle matching on raw_output
- [x] Escape key and backdrop click close the panel

### App — Admin Dashboard
- [x] `/admin` page — admin-only system overview with platform-wide stats
- [x] `loadSystemStats()` server action — 7 parallel aggregate count queries via service client (users, products, generations, content, clicks)
- [x] Summary cards: Total Users, Active Users, Waitlisted, Total Products, Generations, Content Pieces, Total Clicks, Generations (7d)
- [x] Recent signups table (last 10) — email, status badge, source, date
- [x] `/admin/users` page — user management (moved from `/admin`)
- [x] `loadAdminUsers()` server action — admin check, merges auth users + profiles + waitlist data via service client
- [x] Waitlist table: email, name, source, signup date, "Activate" button per user
- [x] Active users table: email, role badge (admin=indigo, paid=emerald, free=zinc), join date
- [x] Activate button calls existing `activateUser()` — updates profile status, sends activation email via Resend
- [x] **Invite user** — email input + "Invite" button on users page
- [x] `inviteUser()` server action — admin check, calls `auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail()`, sets profile to active (skips waitlist), Supabase sends branded invite template
- [x] Optimistic UI: activated user moves from waitlist to active table immediately
- [x] Loading spinner on activate button while action is in flight
- [x] Non-admins redirected to `/` on page load
- [x] Sidebar admin section: separator + "ADMIN" label + System (/admin) + Users (/admin/users) — conditional on admin role
- [x] Sidebar order: Admin section above Settings, Settings directly above signed-in user info
- [x] Sidebar stays fixed in viewport — `h-screen` layout with `overflow-y-auto` on both sidebar and main content
- [x] Empty states for both tables with dashed border styling
- [x] Resend client lazy-initialized (`getResend()`) to prevent build-time errors on server components importing admin actions

### App — User Settings Page
- [x] `/settings` page — account management for all authenticated users
- [x] Server component loads profile data (`full_name`, `avatar_url`), passes to client form
- [x] **Profile section** — initials-based avatar circle (from `full_name`) + Full Name text input
- [x] `updateProfile()` server action — auth check, updates `profiles.full_name`, RLS enforced, `revalidatePath`
- [x] **Email section** — shows current email (read-only), new email input, client-side `supabase.auth.updateUser({ email })` triggers confirmation flow
- [x] **Password section** — current password + new password + confirm password inputs
- [x] `updatePassword()` server action — verifies current password via `signInWithPassword`, then `updateUser({ password })`
- [x] Client-side validation: password match check, min 6 chars
- [x] Per-section independent state (saving, error, success) — sections don't interfere with each other
- [x] Success messages auto-dismiss after 4 seconds
- [x] "Settings" nav item in sidebar — gear icon, shown for all users, pinned to bottom of sidebar
- [x] Design matches existing dashboard patterns (card surfaces, indigo focus states, loading spinners)

### App — Performance Scoring Model
- [x] `loadPerformanceScores()` server action — computes scores from existing `links.click_count` data, no new DB tables
- [x] Three scoring dimensions: campaign (click total), avatar (aggregate from campaigns), channel (aggregate from campaigns)
- [x] Normalized 0-100 scale relative to top performer within each dimension
- [x] Score tiers: Top performer (emerald), Moderate (amber), Low (orange), Underperforming (red), No data (zinc)
- [x] Period filtering: All time, 30 days, 7 days — uses `clicks` table for period-filtered counts
- [x] Brain page: performance progress bar + tier label + click count on each avatar card
- [x] Brain page: thin progress bar + click count on each campaign card (when tracked links exist)
- [x] Brain page: period toggle (All time / 30 days / 7 days) next to "Target Avatars" heading
- [x] Analytics page: "Performance Scores" section — 3-column grid (By Avatar, By Channel, Top Campaign Angles) — shown when product selected
- [x] Analytics page: loading spinner while performance data loads, empty state when no click data
- [x] Shared `score-utils.ts` — `getScoreTier()`, `scoreBarColor()`, `scoreTextColor()` used by both pages

### App — Sidebar Fixes
- [x] Sidebar stays fixed in viewport — `h-screen` layout with `overflow-y-auto` on sidebar and main content
- [x] Admin section moved above Settings — order: main nav → Admin → Settings → user info
- [x] Settings directly above signed-in user email/sign-out for all users

### Rebrand: Easy Micro SaaS
- [x] GitHub repo renamed from `micro-machine` to `easy-micro-saas`
- [x] Git remote URL updated
- [x] All "Micro Machine" text → "Easy Micro SaaS" across both apps
- [x] Metadata titles updated in both layout.tsx files
- [x] Favicon: rocket + sparkle icon (indigo rocket body, violet fins/exhaust, 4-point sparkles)
- [x] All inline SVG logos updated across 7 files (sidebar, login, waitlist, navbar, footer, both icon.svg)

## Product Vision: Easy Micro SaaS

### The Big Picture

The marketing engine (current product) becomes one module in a larger platform that guides builders through the full micro-SaaS lifecycle. Most indie hackers jump straight to building and skip the steps that determine whether anyone will care. This product catches them earlier.

**Domain:** easymicrosaas.com
**Journey:** Ideate → Validate → Build → Market

The "product brief" entity is the throughline — created in Ideate, stress-tested in Validate, guided through Build, and activated in Market. Same record, evolving through stages.

### Module 1: Ideate

**Purpose:** Help users find ideas rooted in real demand, not guesswork.

**Mechanism:** Demand signals + guided framework (both combined).

- **Demand signals layer:** Surface what people are actually asking for — Reddit pain points, Google Trends, app store gaps, forum complaints, keyword demand. The AI aggregates and clusters these into opportunity themes.
- **Guided framework layer:** Once a user picks a theme (or brings their own), structured prompts help them shape it into a concrete product concept — target user, core problem, proposed solution, differentiation.
- **Output:** A product brief ready for validation. This becomes the same "product" entity that flows through the rest of the platform.

**Key questions to resolve:**
- Which data sources are feasible and cost-effective? (Reddit API, Google Trends scraping, app store APIs)
- How do we keep demand data fresh enough to be useful?
- How opinionated should the framework be? (Lean Canvas style vs. simpler)

### Module 2: Validate

**Purpose:** Give users evidence-based confidence to build or kill an idea before investing weeks of development.

**Mechanism:** Composite approach — no single validation method works for everyone at this stage, so combine what's available.

**Core components:**

1. **Scorecard (always available)** — Rate the idea across measurable dimensions: demand signals (search volume, community mentions), competition density, technical feasibility, monetisation clarity, market timing. This gives structure even when other data is thin. The score improves as the user completes more validation steps.

2. **AI market research** — Competitor landscape, existing solutions, pricing analysis, gap identification. Caveat: AI knowledge has a cutoff, so this works best paired with live data (from the Ideate module's demand signals). Frame it as "here's what we found" not "here's the definitive answer."

3. **Community testing guidance** — The user likely doesn't have an audience yet, so this is about *where and how* to test, not assuming they already can. Generate tailored test posts for relevant communities (Reddit, Indie Hackers, X), suggest which subreddits/communities match their audience, provide templates for gauging interest without building anything.

4. **Landing page test (later addition)** — Once the Market module exists, this becomes powerful: auto-generate a landing page from the brief, use the marketing engine to drive initial traffic, measure signup intent. This is a natural cross-module feature but requires the Market module to be mature first.

**Output:** A validation report with a composite score, research findings, and a go/no-go recommendation. The product brief gets enriched with validation data that feeds into better marketing output later.

**Key questions to resolve:**
- What score threshold = "validated"? Or is it a spectrum?
- How do we avoid false confidence from AI-only research?
- Should we integrate with any external validation tools?

### Module 3: Build (Assist)

**Purpose:** Guide the user through building their micro-SaaS — not build it for them.

**Mechanism:** Opinionated guidance based on what works for micro-SaaS specifically.

**Possible components:**
- Tech stack recommendations based on the product type (marketplace, tool, API, content platform)
- Project structure templates / boilerplate generation
- Milestone planning (MVP scope, what to cut, what to ship first)
- Integration guidance (payments, auth, hosting — the decisions every builder faces)
- "Ship checklist" — pre-launch readiness checklist

**Key questions to resolve:**
- How deep does Build go? Recommendations only, or actual code/template generation?
- Does this module generate anything, or is it purely advisory?
- Risk of scope creep — this could become an entire product itself

**Note:** This is the module users do themselves. We assist with decisions and structure, not execution. Keep it lightweight.

### Module 4: Market (Current Product)

**Purpose:** Turn the product brief into a structured go-to-market engine.

This is the current marketing module — avatars, campaigns, content generation, scheduling, tracking, analytics. It's the most mature module and the one being built now.

**Future enhancements from other modules:**
- Ideate's demand signals inform better avatar generation
- Validate's research enriches campaign angles (proven pain points, competitor gaps)
- Build's product details enable more accurate content (features, pricing, positioning)

### Navigation & UX Architecture

**Entry flow:** Linear with shortcuts.
- Default path: Ideate → Validate → Build → Market
- Experienced users can jump directly to any module (e.g. "I already have a product" → skip to Market)
- The product brief captures where the user entered, so each module adapts to available context

**App structure:**
- Top-level module switcher (above or replacing current sidebar)
- Each module has its own sidebar nav (current sidebar becomes Market's nav)
- Dashboard becomes a cross-module overview showing all products and their current stage
- Product cards show which stage they're in (ideation / validating / building / marketing)

**Product entity evolution:**
- A product starts as a "seed" in Ideate (just a theme + rough description)
- Validate enriches it with research data and a score
- Build adds technical details and milestones
- Market adds the current fields (channels, avatars, campaigns, content)
- Fields are progressively revealed — Market doesn't show empty Build fields if the user skipped that stage

### Technical Architecture Considerations

**What stays the same:**
- Monorepo structure (pnpm + Turborepo)
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth)
- Next.js App Router
- Current schema for Market module tables

**What changes:**
- `products` table gains a `stage` column (ideation / validation / building / marketing)
- New tables per module (e.g. `validation_reports`, `demand_signals`, `build_milestones`)
- Route structure: `/ideate/...`, `/validate/...`, `/build/...`, `/market/...` (current routes move under `/market`)
- Shared product header/switcher component across all modules
- Module-level feature flags (enable/disable modules per user tier)

**Migration path:**
- Current users (Market-only) are unaffected — their products default to `stage = 'marketing'`
- New modules are additive, not breaking
- Each module can be developed and shipped independently

### Phasing

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | Market module (current) | In progress |
| **Phase 2** | Module shell + navigation architecture | Not started |
| **Phase 3** | Ideate module | Not started |
| **Phase 4** | Validate module | Not started |
| **Phase 5** | Build module (assist) | Not started |
| **Phase 6** | Cross-module intelligence (validate data improves marketing, etc.) | Not started |

**Current priority:** Finish Phase 1 (marketing module) before starting Phase 2.

| 2026-02-10 | Waitlist modal via createPortal | CSS transform on ancestor breaks fixed positioning |
| 2026-02-10 | X/Twitter pill = neutral gray | Blue looked too similar to LinkedIn |
| 2026-02-10 | Content workstreams separation | Social posts (daily), ads (separate strategy), website copy (one-time) are fundamentally different |
| 2026-02-10 | Paid Ads removed from channels → own toggle | Ads are a separate paid strategy, not an organic channel |
| 2026-02-10 | Email stays as social channel | Newsletters/outreach are ongoing; email sequences are website kit deliverables |
| 2026-02-10 | Ad strategy: retargeting + cold traffic | Reuse best social angles for retargeting, dedicated angles for cold traffic |
| 2026-02-10 | Website kit: full kit | Landing page, 3 welcome emails, meta description, 3 taglines |
| 2026-02-10 | Archive only, no delete (original) | CASCADE deletes would destroy all generated content permanently |
| 2026-02-11 | Admin-only delete added | Admins can permanently delete products; cascade handles all child records; confirmation dialog required |
| 2026-02-10 | Status management available to all users | Changing content status (draft/approved/scheduled/posted) is not admin-only |
| 2026-02-10 | Archived is a boolean flag, not a status | Preserves workflow status when archiving — "Published, Archived" instead of losing the original status |
| 2026-02-10 | Product archive cascades via archived flag | Sets archived=true on campaigns + content without touching workflow status |
| 2026-02-11 | Email as its own category | Email campaigns and email sequences separated from Social and Website respectively |
| 2026-02-11 | Pill tabs for category filters | Segmented control (All/Social/Email/Ads/Website) replaces dropdown for cleaner UI |
| 2026-02-11 | Archive icon toggle replaces checkbox | Compact icon button with active state, declutters filter bar |
| 2026-02-11 | Count badge right-aligned, not in filter row | Filtered count visually separated from filter controls to avoid ambiguity |
| 2026-02-11 | Archive toggle = exclusive views | Active and archived content shown separately, not mixed — cleaner mental model |
| 2026-02-11 | Email Copy separated from Website Kit on brain page | Email sequences are a distinct deliverable, not part of the website kit section |
| 2026-02-11 | Video-hook removed, consolidated to video-script | Video scripts already include a hook — separate video-hook type was redundant |
| 2026-02-11 | Content format preferences at intake | Users choose text/images/video at product creation; brain prompt respects selection; default all selected |
| 2026-02-12 | revalidatePath on all mutations | Server actions must invalidate Next.js cache to prevent stale data across page navigation |
| 2026-02-12 | Generate All skips existing content | Bulk generation only targets campaigns without content; prevents duplicate pieces |
| 2026-02-12 | Regenerate replaces, not appends | Single campaign regeneration deletes old pieces first; clean replacement instead of accumulation |
| 2026-02-12 | Dashboard shows active + archived sections | Archived products remain visible on dashboard in a dimmer "Archived Products" section |
| 2026-02-12 | Dedicated Archive page with drill-down | Sidebar nav item; expandable product cards with campaign details and slide-over panel for content |
| 2026-02-12 | Archive page reuses CampaignPanel | Consistent UX — clicking a campaign anywhere opens the same slide-over with content pieces |
| 2026-02-12 | Per-campaign destination URLs with product fallback | Each campaign can have its own landing page; falls back to product website_url when not set |
| 2026-02-12 | Tracked links separate from AI content body | Links displayed as copyable UI element, not embedded in generated text — works for all content types, user places link where they want |
| 2026-02-12 | Auto-generate tracked links on content generation | Links created automatically when content is generated (if destination URL available) — no manual step |
| 2026-02-12 | nanoid 8-char slugs for tracked links | Short, clean, collision-resistant; lowercase alphanumeric only |
| 2026-02-12 | Service role client for click logging | Clicks table has no client-side insert RLS policy by design; service role key bypasses RLS for server-side click inserts |
| 2026-02-12 | Privacy-safe click logging | IP addresses hashed (SHA-256 truncated); country from Vercel header; no PII stored |
| 2026-02-12 | No charting library for v1 analytics | CSS-based bar chart + data tables; keeps bundle small, avoids dependency for simple v1 |
| 2026-02-13 | UTM params removed from tracked link redirects | Internal click tracking captures full attribution server-side; UTM params cluttered the URL for end users and are redundant |
| 2026-02-13 | Dynamic filter counts on tab badges | Tab counts (Social/Email/Ads/Website) update based on active filters instead of showing static totals |
| 2026-02-13 | Internal files gitignored | EMS_PLAN.md, SQL migrations, .claude/ removed from repo for public-readiness |
| 2026-02-13 | Grouped channel selection in intake | 12 channels organized into Social Media, Communities, Content & Outreach — 3-column grid with section headers |
| 2026-02-13 | Multi-format ad content generation | Ad campaigns produce full creative package (copy + image + video) based on content_formats preference; Google stays text-only |
| 2026-02-13 | Ad prompt engineering with frameworks | Brain and content prompts use PAS, AIDA, BAB frameworks with platform-specific guidance for higher-quality ad output |
| 2026-02-13 | Meta Ad Library API deferred to short-term | Free API exists; can filter for long-running ads (proxy for success); better as a dedicated feature after launch |
| 2026-02-13 | Instagram maps to image-prompt/video-script | Instagram is visual-first; standalone captions don't make sense; channel-aware format instructions guide visual content |
| 2026-02-13 | Marketing site aligned to SITE Framework | Problem-led hero, value exchange (not feature list), GlowCards for depth, unified "Get Early Access" CTAs |
| 2026-02-13 | Outfit + DM Sans fonts across both apps | Consistent brand typography; Outfit for headings (confident), DM Sans for body (clean, readable) |
| 2026-02-13 | Indigo/violet accent system | `#818cf8 → #a78bfa` gradient replaces blue/cyan; consistent across logo, favicon, focus states, charts, links |
| 2026-02-13 | Dashboard card surfaces: white alpha | `white/[0.02]` bg + `white/[0.06]` borders instead of zinc-800/zinc-900 — more depth, consistent with marketing site |
| 2026-02-13 | Waitlist gate via profile.status column | Separates access gating (waitlist/active) from subscription tier (free/paid/admin); avoids overloading the role field |
| 2026-02-13 | Sign-up creates account but gates access | Users get a real Supabase auth account + waitlist entry; admin flips status to `active` when ready to grant access |
| 2026-02-16 | posted_at separate from status workflow | "Published" is internal readiness (draft/ready/published); "posted" means content is live on the platform — orthogonal concerns |
| 2026-02-16 | Posted filter as dropdown, not tab | Posted/unposted cuts across all categories; keeps category tabs for content type filtering |
| 2026-02-16 | Weekly calendar only (no month view) | Social content planning is week-by-week; 7-day view fits desktop well; month view would make cards too small |
| 2026-02-16 | No drag-and-drop for v1 calendar | Click-to-schedule with native date picker covers 90% of use cases; dnd-kit deferred to polish phase |
| 2026-02-16 | Unscheduled pool limited to 50 pieces | Prevents overwhelming UI; encourages scheduling or archiving old content |
| 2026-02-16 | No new dependencies for calendar | Native Date API + HTML5 date input sufficient; date-fns deferred unless timezone support needed |
| 2026-02-16 | Posted content dimmed to 60% opacity | Visual de-emphasis signals "done"; keeps focus on unposted content as work queue |
| 2026-02-16 | Unified content lifecycle replaces fragmented system | Single LifecycleAction component replaces StatusSelect + PostedToggle + native date picker — clearer UX |
| 2026-02-16 | Draft → Approved → Scheduled → Posted | Linear by default but with shortcuts (scheduling a draft auto-approves) — never blocks user with mandatory intermediate steps |
| 2026-02-16 | Custom DatePicker replaces native date input | Native `<input type="date">` looks off-brand on dark theme; custom calendar matches design system with zero new dependencies |
| 2026-02-16 | Status constraint migration with data migration | Migration 00011 safely converts old statuses (`ready`→`approved`, `published`→`approved`, infers `posted`/`scheduled` from timestamps) |
| 2026-02-17 | Product vision: Easy Micro SaaS | Full lifecycle platform — Ideate → Validate → Build → Market. Domain: easymicrosaas.com. Marketing module is Phase 1, other modules are additive |
| 2026-02-17 | Ideate = demand signals + guided framework | Both combined: surface real demand from Reddit/Trends/forums, then guide user to shape it into a product concept |
| 2026-02-17 | Validate = composite approach | Scorecard (always available) + AI research + community testing guidance. Landing page test deferred until Market module is mature |
| 2026-02-17 | Build = assist, not execute | Guidance on tech stack, milestones, ship checklist. Users build it themselves; we help with decisions |
| 2026-02-17 | Linear with shortcuts navigation | Default Ideate→Validate→Build→Market flow, but users can jump directly to any module |
| 2026-02-17 | scheduled_for DATE → TIMESTAMPTZ | Day-level scheduling upgraded to time-level; 30-min slots with 9:00 AM default; existing dates migrated to 09:00 UTC |
| 2026-02-17 | DatePicker with time slot grid | Calendar + scrollable time grid in one popover; confirm button emits ISO timestamp; no external dependencies |
| 2026-02-17 | Rebrand to Easy Micro SaaS | Domain easymicrosaas.com; all text, logos, metadata updated across both apps |
| 2026-02-17 | Rocket + sparkle favicon | Conceptual icon (launch + magic) instead of text monogram; indigo/violet palette; works at all sizes |
| 2026-02-17 | Dark dropdown styling standardised | `bg-zinc-900 [&>option]:bg-zinc-900` applied to all `<select>` elements across 4 dashboard pages |
| 2026-02-17 | Middleware skip for server actions | `next-action` header check prevents middleware from redirecting POST requests for server actions (fixed waitlist insert) |
| 2026-02-17 | Supabase lint fixes (migrations 00012-00014) | Fixed mutable search_path, duplicate indexes, and RLS auth.uid() per-row re-evaluation |
| 2026-02-19 | Generate content available to all users | Admin-only gating on generate/regenerate buttons removed; all authenticated active users can generate brain + content; delete and archive remain admin-only |
| 2026-02-19 | Calendar cards → slide-over panel | Inline expansion made columns too long with multiple posts; compact cards now open a slide-over panel for full content view |
| 2026-02-19 | Bulk status changes on content page | Checkbox per card + sticky bottom toolbar with contextual Approve/Schedule/Mark Posted actions; smart targeting skips pieces already in target status |
| 2026-02-19 | Resend for transactional email | Resend chosen over Postmark for simpler integration, React email templates, generous free tier |
| 2026-02-20 | Hosted img tag for email logos | Inline SVGs don't render in Gmail/Outlook; `<img src="easymicrosaas.com/favicon.svg">` used instead |
| 2026-02-20 | Fire-and-forget email sending | Waitlist confirmation emails don't block the response; failures logged but don't affect user flow |
| 2026-02-20 | Duplicate signup detection before email | Check for existing waitlist entry before sending confirmation; prevents re-sending on duplicate signups |
| 2026-02-20 | Supabase email templates in repo | 6 branded HTML templates stored in `supabase/templates/` for copy-paste into Supabase dashboard; version controlled alongside code |
| 2026-02-20 | Avatars read from DB, not raw_output | Brain page switched from frozen `generation.raw_output` to live `avatars` table; edits automatically flow to content generation; raw_output stays as immutable audit trail |
| 2026-02-20 | Old avatars deactivated on regeneration | `is_active = false` set on existing avatars before inserting new ones; prevents stale + new duplicates without deleting history |
| 2026-02-20 | Avatar-campaign link via FK, not angle matching | `getAvatarName` uses `avatar_id` foreign key instead of matching campaign angle against raw_output — reliable after avatar edits or regeneration |
| 2026-02-20 | Slide-over panel for avatar editing | Same UX pattern as CampaignPanel; inline editing would be too cramped in 3-column grid especially for arrays (pain points) and multi-select (channels) |
| 2026-02-20 | Admin section in sidebar | Separator + "ADMIN" label + sub-links replaces single flat "Users" link; Settings pinned to bottom of sidebar for all users |
| 2026-02-20 | Admin split: system overview + users | `/admin` = platform stats (server component), `/admin/users` = user management (client component); separation of concerns |
| 2026-02-20 | Invite users via Supabase admin API | `auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail()` sends branded invite template; invited users set to `status: 'active'` (skip waitlist) |
| 2026-02-20 | Lazy Resend initialization | `getResend()` singleton replaces top-level `new Resend()`; prevents build-time errors when server components import modules that transitively import Resend |
| 2026-02-20 | Admin user list merges three data sources | Auth users (emails), profiles (role/status), waitlist (name/source) combined via service client; single server action returns complete picture |
| 2026-02-20 | Email logo SVG → PNG | SVGs don't render in Gmail/Outlook; 80x80 PNG generated via sharp, hosted at `easymicrosaas.com/logo.png`; all 8 templates updated |
| 2026-02-20 | Settings page at /settings route | Dedicated page for account management; three independent sections (profile, email, password); available to all authenticated users |
| 2026-02-20 | Password change requires current password | Server action verifies current password via `signInWithPassword` before allowing update; prevents session-only password changes |
| 2026-02-20 | Email change via browser client | `supabase.auth.updateUser({ email })` called client-side so confirmation email redirect works correctly; server-side SSR client can have unreliable redirectTo |
| 2026-02-20 | Initials avatar for v1 | No file upload infrastructure needed; `avatar_url` column exists for future Supabase Storage upload |
