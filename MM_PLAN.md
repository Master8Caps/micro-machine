# Micro Machine — Project Plan

## Project Overview

Micro Machine is an internal-first SaaS product that turns a simple product brief into a structured early-growth engine. It helps find the right avatars, test positioning, and acquire the first 100 users for micro-SaaS products.

**Primary audience (initial):** Internal micro-SaaS products built by the team.
**Future audience:** Solo founders, indie hackers, early-stage SaaS teams.

### What It Does

1. Collects a short product/market/goals brief
2. Identifies and refines target avatars (ICPs)
3. Generates social campaign angles per avatar per channel
4. Generates ad campaign angles (retargeting + cold traffic) if user opts in
5. Generates a website kit (landing page copy, welcome emails, meta descriptions, taglines) if user has a website
6. Produces channel-specific content pieces with copy-to-clipboard
7. Tracks clicks and early engagement signals via redirect links
8. (Future) Identifies winning hooks/angles/avatars and regenerates based on performance

### Architecture

- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- **Marketing site** (`apps/marketing`): Conversion-focused single page, deployed to `yourdomain.com`
- **App** (`apps/app`): SaaS application, deployed to `app.yourdomain.com`
- **Shared packages:** UI components, TypeScript configs, shared types

- [x] Content workstreams separation — migration 00004 (has_website, wants_ads, campaign categories, expanded content types)
- [x] Archived separated from workflow status — migration 00005 (archived boolean on campaigns + content_pieces, removed from status constraint)
- [x] Content format preferences — migration 00006 (content_formats column on products, video-hook removed from constraints)

- [x] Step 4: "Do you want to run paid ads?" toggle + platform multi-select (Meta, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn Ads)
- [x] Step 4: Content format preferences — multi-select cards (Text, Images, Video) with green checkmarks, all selected by default, at least one required
- [x] "Paid Ads" removed from social channels list (7 organic channels remain)

### App — Marketing Brain Generation
- [x] Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 integration (real, not mocked)
- [x] Structured JSON output — avatars, social campaigns, ad campaigns (conditional), website kit (conditional)
- [x] Avatars saved to DB with ICPs, pain points, channels
- [x] Social campaigns saved with category='social'
- [x] Ad campaigns saved with category='ad' (retargeting + cold traffic angles)
- [x] Website kit saved as content_pieces (landing page copy, 3 welcome emails, meta description, 3 taglines)
- [x] Brain results page with regenerate functionality
- [x] Fix: Brain page reloads data from DB after first-time generation

### App — Brain Page UI
- [x] Five distinct sections: Target Avatars, Social Campaigns, Ad Campaigns, Email Copy, Website Kit
- [x] Email Copy section separated from Website Kit (email-sequence pieces shown independently)
- [x] Ad Campaigns, Email Copy, and Website Kit sections conditionally shown based on product settings / data

- [x] Bulk "Generate All" for social and ad campaigns separately
- [x] Content-type-specific prompts (LinkedIn posts, tweets, threads, video scripts, image prompts, landing pages, emails, ad copy)
- [x] Content format preferences respected — brain prompt dynamically builds content types list from user's selected formats (text/images/video)
- [x] Inline content preview on brain page (expandable)
- [x] Copy-to-clipboard with "Copied!" feedback
- [x] Fix: "Generate All" skips campaigns that already have content (no more duplicates)
- [x] Fix: "Generate All" button shows dynamic label — "Generate Remaining (N)" when some done, "All Generated" when complete
- [x] Fix: Single "Regenerate Content" replaces old pieces instead of appending duplicates (deletes then inserts)

### App — Campaigns Page
- [x] Social / Email / Ads tab bar (Email and Ads tabs shown only when those campaigns exist)
- [x] Email campaigns separated from Social (channel="Email" gets own tab)
- [x] Product and channel/platform filter dropdowns
- [x] Campaign count right-aligned next to tabs (not in filter row)
- [x] Slide-over panel on click (instead of navigating to brain page)
- [x] Panel shows: campaign details, generate/regenerate button (admin), content pieces (compact, click-to-expand)

- [x] Expandable body preview (line-clamp-3)
- [x] Copy-to-clipboard on each piece

### App — Archiving & Status
- [x] Archived is a separate boolean flag, not a status value
- [x] Workflow status (draft/ready/published) preserved when archiving — e.g. "Published, Archived"
- [x] Product archive cascades: sets `archived=true` on all campaigns and content pieces (preserves their workflow status)
- [x] Product reactivate cascades: sets `archived=false` on all campaigns and content pieces
- [x] Archive toggle button on each content piece (content page + campaign panel)
- [x] Archive toggle is exclusive view — shows either active or archived content, not mixed
- [x] Dashboard shows Active Products and Archived Products as separate sections
- [x] Archived products styled dimmer but still visible and clickable on dashboard
- [x] Campaigns page filters out archived campaigns (only shows active)
- [x] Dashboard stats (products, campaigns, content) count only active/non-archived items
- [x] Dedicated Archive page in sidebar nav — shows archived products with expandable campaign details
- [x] Archive page: clickable campaigns open slide-over panel (reuses CampaignPanel) with content pieces
- [x] Archive page: admin "Reactivate Product" button per product

### App — Product Delete (Admin Only)
- [x] `deleteProduct()` server action with admin role check (server-side enforcement)

- [x] Delete button on brain page header (red, admin-only) with confirmation dialog
- [x] Delete button on dashboard product cards (trash icon, admin-only) with confirmation dialog
- [x] `ProductDeleteButton` client component (handles click interception inside Link wrapper)
- [x] Confirmation modal shows product name, warns about permanent deletion

### App — Role-Based Access
- [x] `getUserWithRole()` in server/auth.ts
- [x] UserContext React context providing `{ email, role }` to all client components
- [x] Dashboard layout wraps children in UserProvider
- [x] Generate/regenerate buttons: admin only (brain page, campaign panel)
- [x] Archive/reactivate, regenerate brain: admin only
- [x] Delete product: admin only (brain page + dashboard)
- [x] Status dropdown (StatusSelect): available to all users
- [x] Non-admin users see "Generated" badge instead of regenerate buttons

### App — Link Tracking & Analytics
- [x] Campaign destination URL — per-campaign URL field with product website_url fallback
- [x] Migration 00007: `destination_url` column on campaigns table
- [x] Tracked link generation — auto-creates unique `/r/{slug}` redirect links when content is generated (if destination URL exists)
- [x] nanoid slug generation (8-char lowercase alphanumeric)
- [x] Auto UTM parameters — utm_source (channel), utm_medium (category), utm_campaign (angle), utm_content (title)
- [x] Redirect endpoint `/r/[slug]` — looks up link in DB, logs click (user agent, referer, IP hash, country, device type), appends UTM params, 302 redirects
- [x] Service role Supabase client for click logging (bypasses RLS per schema design)
- [x] Click counter auto-increment via existing DB trigger (clicks insert → links.click_count++)
- [x] Destination URL input on campaign panel (inline edit with save/cancel)
- [x] Tracked link display on content pieces — both campaign panel and content page (blue mono link + click count + copy button)
- [x] "Tracked" badge on campaign cards when destination URL is set
- [x] Analytics dashboard — summary cards (total clicks, 7-day, 30-day, active links), 30-day bar chart, top 10 links table, clicks by channel with progress bars
- [x] Analytics product filter dropdown
- [x] Content page query includes links data via Supabase FK join

### App — UI Components
- [x] `ChannelPill` — platform-colored (LinkedIn, X, Reddit, Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, Email, Blog, Meta, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn Ads)
- [x] `TypePill` — indigo tint, format-specific labels (Text Post, Thread, Video Script, Image Post, Landing Page, Email Sequence, Meta Description, Tagline, etc.)
- [x] `StatusPill` — active/published (emerald), draft (amber), archived (zinc), ready (blue)
- [x] `StatusSelect` — colored dropdown that looks like a pill but is selectable (Draft/Ready/Published only)
- [x] `ArchivedBadge` — gray "Archived" pill, shown alongside workflow status
- [x] `ArchiveToggle` — archive/unarchive icon button on content pieces
- [x] `CopyButton` — clipboard icon with green checkmark feedback

## Link Tracking Test Results (2026-02-13)

> Migration `00007_campaign_destination_url.sql` — Applied.

### Passed
1. **Campaign destination URL** — Destination URL section appears in panel, edit/save/clear all work, "Tracked" badge shows on campaign cards. Contrast improved with background styling.
2. **Tracked link auto-generation** — Links generate correctly. **Fixed:** tracked links now appear immediately in the campaign panel after generation (previously required closing/reopening the panel).
7. **Content page — tracked links** — Link rows display correctly with click counts and copy buttons. Loads across all category filters.
8. **Existing features** — Dashboard, generate/regenerate, status changes, archive toggles, archive page all working.

### Fixed
- Destination URL display contrast improved (background box + monospace styling)
- Tracked links now included in generation response (re-fetch after link creation)
- Campaign-level total clicks now shown on campaign cards

### Still to Test
3. **Tracked link fallback** — Product website_url used when campaign has no destination URL
4. **No destination URL** — No tracked links when neither campaign nor product has a URL
5. **Redirect endpoint** — Test with a real URL to confirm 302 redirect + UTM params. Click counts visible in analytics. Need to verify click count updates on content page after clicking.
6. **Analytics page** — Full testing of summary cards, chart, top links table, channel breakdown, product filter

| 2026-02-10 | Anthropic as primary LLM, OpenAI for embeddings | Best generation quality + best embedding ecosystem |
| 2026-02-10 | Marketing site = waitlist, App = auth | Marketing captures interest, app handles login/signup |
| 2026-02-10 | User roles: admin / free / paid | Build with roles from the start, only admins use initially |
| 2026-02-10 | Waitlist modal via createPortal | CSS transform on ancestor breaks fixed positioning |
| 2026-02-10 | X/Twitter pill = neutral gray | Blue looked too similar to LinkedIn |
| 2026-02-10 | Content workstreams separation | Social posts (daily), ads (separate strategy), website copy (one-time) are fundamentally different |
| 2026-02-10 | Paid Ads removed from channels → own toggle | Ads are a separate paid strategy, not an organic channel |
| 2026-02-10 | Email stays as social channel | Newsletters/outreach are ongoing; email sequences are website kit deliverables |
| 2026-02-10 | Ad strategy: retargeting + cold traffic | Reuse best social angles for retargeting, dedicated angles for cold traffic |
| 2026-02-10 | Website kit: full kit | Landing page, 3 welcome emails, meta description, 3 taglines |
| 2026-02-10 | Archive only, no delete (original) | CASCADE deletes would destroy all generated content permanently |
| 2026-02-11 | Admin-only delete added | Admins can permanently delete products; cascade handles all child records; confirmation dialog required |
| 2026-02-10 | Status management available to all users | Changing content status (draft/ready/published) is not admin-only |
| 2026-02-10 | Archived is a boolean flag, not a status | Preserves workflow status when archiving — "Published, Archived" instead of losing the original status |
| 2026-02-10 | Product archive cascades via archived flag | Sets archived=true on campaigns + content without touching workflow status |
| 2026-02-11 | Email as its own category | Email campaigns and email sequences separated from Social and Website respectively |
| 2026-02-11 | Pill tabs for category filters | Segmented control (All/Social/Email/Ads/Website) replaces dropdown for cleaner UI |
| 2026-02-11 | Archive icon toggle replaces checkbox | Compact icon button with active state, declutters filter bar |
| 2026-02-11 | Count badge right-aligned, not in filter row | Filtered count visually separated from filter controls to avoid ambiguity |
| 2026-02-11 | Archive toggle = exclusive views | Active and archived content shown separately, not mixed — cleaner mental model |
| 2026-02-11 | Email Copy separated from Website Kit on brain page | Email sequences are a distinct deliverable, not part of the website kit section |
| 2026-02-11 | Video-hook removed, consolidated to video-script | Video scripts already include a hook — separate video-hook type was redundant |
| 2026-02-11 | Content format preferences at intake | Users choose text/images/video at product creation; brain prompt respects selection; default all selected |
| 2026-02-12 | revalidatePath on all mutations | Server actions must invalidate Next.js cache to prevent stale data across page navigation |
| 2026-02-12 | Generate All skips existing content | Bulk generation only targets campaigns without content; prevents duplicate pieces |
| 2026-02-12 | Regenerate replaces, not appends | Single campaign regeneration deletes old pieces first; clean replacement instead of accumulation |
| 2026-02-12 | Dashboard shows active + archived sections | Archived products remain visible on dashboard in a dimmer "Archived Products" section |
| 2026-02-12 | Dedicated Archive page with drill-down | Sidebar nav item; expandable product cards with campaign details and slide-over panel for content |
| 2026-02-12 | Archive page reuses CampaignPanel | Consistent UX — clicking a campaign anywhere opens the same slide-over with content pieces |
| 2026-02-12 | Per-campaign destination URLs with product fallback | Each campaign can have its own landing page; falls back to product website_url when not set |
| 2026-02-12 | Tracked links separate from AI content body | Links displayed as copyable UI element, not embedded in generated text — works for all content types, user places link where they want |
| 2026-02-12 | Auto-generate tracked links on content generation | Links created automatically when content is generated (if destination URL available) — no manual step |
| 2026-02-12 | nanoid 8-char slugs for tracked links | Short, clean, collision-resistant; lowercase alphanumeric only |
| 2026-02-12 | Service role client for click logging | Clicks table has no client-side insert RLS policy by design; service role key bypasses RLS for server-side click inserts |
| 2026-02-12 | Privacy-safe click logging | IP addresses hashed (SHA-256 truncated); country from Vercel header; no PII stored |
| 2026-02-12 | No charting library for v1 analytics | CSS-based bar chart + data tables; keeps bundle small, avoids dependency for simple v1 |
